These are my basic dotfiles.
They are here to provide me a simple yet nearly fully customized starting point when hopping or reinstalling distros
These will always pair perfectly with dwm (especyially my patched version), dmenu, st and picom.
Because people who are using these should know what they do with them, I wont give help on how to use them here.
